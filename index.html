            <h2>What is my favorite CMSC subject so far and why<span class="qsmark">?</span></h2>
            <p>My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 12 since it
                focuses on studying the syntax of python and applying 
                it on different problems. Aside from that, it is the
                easiest programming language thought to us when compared
                to our other CMSC subjects.
            </p>

            <h2>What is my favorite GE so far and why<span class="qsmark">?</span></h2>
            <p>My favorite GE so far is Ethics 1 since it tackled the nature of our
                ethics and moral reasoning. Additionally, I like how the discussions
                are always fruitful since it is our responsibility to be wary of our
                moral thinking and actions as well.
            </p>

            <h2>What is my favorite programming language so far and why<span class="qsmark">?</span></h2>
            <p>Contrary to my answer for my favorite subject, my favorite programming
                language so far is Java. Aside from having semi-colons to end a single
                line, I really liked the versatility of the language itself and the use
                of switch-case statements.

            <h2>What is my childhood dream<span class="qsmark">?</span></h2>

               while living a simple life with my family.
